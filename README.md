Raspberry Pi based Photography Camera

Inspired by the CinePi and previous attempts to make a Raspberry Pi based camera on YouTube I made The PiBZ V0.

This is still a work in progress but I hope that it is a good starting off point for others.

**Some notes on the screen**

I personaly had difficulty with the driver, but there are reviews on Amazon that talk about how to set it up
I would suggest looking at an alternitive screen if you are capable of adjusting the cad files
